# MRUpgradeNotification

## Well, not a nag, but a "reminder"

This is a simple singleton class that will automatically
check the app store every day and alert the user at launch
when there's a new application version available.

## Usage

Adding this class to your project is simple:

1. Import the header file into your application delegate
2. Add this code to your `application:application didFinishLaunching` function:

    	[MRUpgradeNag checkUpgradeForAppID:123456];

Where `123456` is your application's App Store ID

## Dependencies

This project relies on Stig Brautaset's superb JSON parsing library: [json-framework](https://github.com/stig/json-framework/). You must have this library in your project for this code to work properly.
